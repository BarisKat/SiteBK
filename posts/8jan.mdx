title: First post starting to learn to program/code for the third time.
description: "Hi world,

Today is Januari the 8th 2023, and this is the third time I'm trying to learn to program.
It's also the third time I try, as I've failed in the past.
My plan is to study for 2 hours a day, 7 days a week.
I'll be starting with the CS50's course Introduction to Computer Science as this is the most recommended as far as I've seen.

I'll be writing a blog post every time I've finished a lecture to monitor my progress and descripe where and what issue's I run in too.
This blog will be purely writin for me, and this time I promise to finish this course no matter how hard it's get.

Kind regards,
Baris
